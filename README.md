# DSS - Racing Manager Simulation

This project was developed as part of the **Software Systems Development** course in the Computer Engineering program at the University of Minho. The goal is to design and implement a simulation-based application where users manage and compete in car racing championships, inspired by games like F1 Manager.

## Project Objective

The application allows users to:

- Create and manage racing championships.
- Add circuits, cars and drivers to the system.
- Configure races using customizable parameters.
- Simulate races and view results across multiple events and seasons.

## Usage Scenarios

### Championship Management

Administrators can create and configure championships, select circuits and make them available for players to participate in.

### Circuit Configuration

New circuits can be added with detailed information such as total length, number of curves, chicanes and overtaking difficulty (OD) for each segment.

### Car Management

Cars can be registered into the system by specifying key technical characteristics such as category, brand, model, engine capacity, power and aerodynamic profile.

### Driver Management

Drivers are created with skill levels across different racing conditions (e.g., dry vs. rainy weather) and behavioral traits (e.g., aggressiveness vs. safety).

### Game Simulation

Players can choose drivers and cars, configure car settings and participate in simulated races. The system processes race events and provides detailed performance and result tracking.
